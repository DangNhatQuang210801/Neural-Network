# Handwritten Digit Recognition Notebooks

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate foundational steps in building a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using Python. The code originates from coursework completed through Coursera and was modified for clarity and reuse.

## üìÅ Notebooks Included

### 1. `Derivative.ipynb`
Introduces the concept of derivatives and how they relate to optimization in machine learning. Simple visual examples are used to illustrate slope and gradient concepts.

### 2. `Back propagation.ipynb`
Explains the backpropagation algorithm in neural networks. Covers step-by-step gradient calculation and parameter updates using derivatives.

### 3. `Handwritten Digit 0-1.ipynb`
Builds a basic neural network that classifies digits into two categories: `0` vs `1`. This is a binary classification task using basic forward and backward propagation.

### 4. `Handwritten Digit Recognition.ipynb`
Extends the previous notebook to support multiclass classification for all digits (`0‚Äì9`) using a fully connected neural network. Includes softmax activation and cross-entropy loss.
